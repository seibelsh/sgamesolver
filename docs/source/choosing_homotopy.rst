Choosing a homotopy
===================

After having defined the stochastic game of interest,
the next step is to choose a suitable homotopy.

In sGameSolver, the following homotopies are implemented:

1. :doc:`choosing_homotopy_qre`
2. :doc:`choosing_homotopy_logtracing`

.. toctree::
    :hidden:

    choosing_homotopy_qre
    choosing_homotopy_logtracing
