Interacting with the solver
===========================

This section introduces some ways to interact with the solver
which performs the numerical path tracking
via :doc:`predictor-corrector iterations <predictor_corrector_procedure>`.

The solver's basic usage is simple:
First, set up a game, choose a homotopy and,
if desired, make any last adjustments to the *homotopy* parameters:

.. code-block:: python

    import sgamesolver
    game = sgamesolver.SGame.random_game(64, 2, 4, seed=31)
    homotopy = sgamesolver.homotopy.LogTracing(game)
    homotopy.eta = 0.1

Next, set up the solver by calling :py:meth:`~.solver_setup`:

.. code-block:: python

    homotopy.solver_setup()

:py:meth:`~.solver_setup` essentially does 2 things: It computes the starting point ``y0``
(which is why you should fix homotopy parameters beforehand); and
it instantiates a solver, an object of class :py:class:`HomContSolver` which is
responsible for the path tracking algorithm. You can access it via the
attribute :py:attr:`~.solver` of your homotopy:

>>> print(homotopy.solver)
<sgamesolver.homcont.HomContSolver object at 0x000001FC9481FDC0>

Now would be a good time to make adjustments to the
:doc:`solver parameters <solver_parameters>` if desired.
Then, it will ideally be sufficient to just let it run its course:

.. code-block:: python

    homotopy.solve()

However, there might be situations in which you'd like to interact
with it during solution: To pause or go back a bit,
then adjust parameters before proceeding. The following can help with that.

Saving and loading the solver state
-----------------------------------

The state is updated at the end of each predictor-corrector step.
It essentially consists of

- ``y`` before the next predictor step
- current step size ``ds``
- some additional variables
  (orientation, total path length traveled, step number, consecutive successes)

Importantly, these quantities together completely determine future behavior:
Returning to a previous state and re-starting the solver
will reproduce the exact same results
(assuming no parameter changes, of course).

Storing the state has (at least) two use cases:

- It allows to pause the computation, e.g. to reboot, or to
  transfer to another machine without having to start from
  the beginning again.
- It allows to repeatedly re-start from the same position with
  different parameter sets,
  in particular when trying to navigate through a difficult, badly
  conditioned area.

The solver state can be saved to a text file
using the method :py:meth:`~.save_file`:

>>> homotopy.solver.save_file('example.txt')
Current state saved as example.txt.

You can then always return to that state later (even after a reboot or
on another computer) by invoking the method :py:meth:`~.load_file`:

>>> homotopy.solver.load_file('example.txt')
State successfully loaded from example.txt.

.. warning ::
    The solver state does **not** include (i) solver parameters or (ii) the
    game and homotopy parameters. If you want to restart from the saved state later on,
    you need to ensure that these can be recreated (e.g. by keeping the
    script that defined the game and set any parameters.)

Note that the created file is in plain-text and can be opened with any text editor.
It contains a description field where you can add comments or things to remember.

Storing the path
----------------

If you enable path storing, the solver will keep a record
of past states (updated after each successful step). This
allows

(a) to return to any of the recorded states later on; for example
    to adjust parameters and start again from there, if a difficult
    spot is encountered.

(b) to later plot, analyze, or save the path the solver has taken.
    This might be of interest in its own right (e.g. when analyzing the
    QRE correpsondence of a game). It can also help with identifying if
    the solver is stuck in a loop,
    as explained in section :doc:`troubleshooting </troubleshooting>`.

Path storing has to be activated manually; this can be done any time
after the solver has been set up:

.. code-block:: python

    import sgamesolver
    game = sgamesolver.SGame.random_game(8, 4, 4, seed=42)
    homotopy = sgamesolver.homotopy.LogTracing(game)
    homotopy.solver_setup()

    homotopy.solver.start_storing_path()

Note that storing the path comes at a small cost in
performance and memory.

By the way: By default, the solver path will store 1000 past states;
whenever that number is reached, all but every
10th currently saved steps are discarded, and recording resumes normally.
To if you want to change
this maximum number, use e.g

>>>homotopy.solver.start_storing_path(num_steps=25000)



Returning to a past step on the path
************************************

If path storing has been enabled, it is possible to return to past
steps via

.. code-block::

    # continues the example above
    homotopy.solver.max_steps = 200
    homotopy.solve()
    homotopy.solver.return_to_step(step_no = 123)

You could now change parameters and call ``.solve()`` again to start
from this step. Note that you could also save this specific solver state for
later use (see above) â€“ note that the path itself is not stored
when doing that.

Plotting the path
*****************

The path can be plotted from the homotopy object
(which, unlike the solver, is aware of the meaning of the variables,
thus can split the plot into states etc.):abbr:

.. code-block::  python

    # continues the example above
    homotopy.plot_path()

By default, this uses arc length s as x-axis; to use step number instead,
call ``.plot_path(x_axis="step")``. You can also zoom in
on a specific range of s or of step number:


.. code-block:: python

    # continues the example above
    homotopy.plot_path(s_range=(500,700))
    # or:
    homotopy.plot_path(step_range=(125,175))
