Solving games
=============

In sGameSolver, stationary equilibria can be found using the :py:meth:`solve` method
of the chosen homotopy class.

Solving a stochastic game requires two steps:

1. Setting up the solver and finding a starting point.
2. Starting the solver and letting it run until convergence is achived.
