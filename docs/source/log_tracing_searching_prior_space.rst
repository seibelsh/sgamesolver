Log Tracing: Searching the prior space
======================================

The logarithmic tracing homotopy crucially depends on the prior belief
about players' strategies.
For different priors, the homotopy path leads to
potentially different equilibria.
By searching the prior space,
either randomly or systematically,
one can find multiple equilibria for a given game,
and assess the basins of attractions for each equilibrium.

Note, however, that this method does generally *not* allow
to find all equilibria of a given game.
For unstable equilibria, the corresponding basins of attraction
reduce to single points in the prior space,
which are likely to be missed.
